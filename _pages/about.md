I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at **UC San Diego**, where I work with [Prof. Jishen Zhao](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jzhao/)'s STABLE Lab on **agent memory** and **ML systems**. I spent summer 2026 as a Software Engineer Intern (AI Agent) at [Moody's Analytics](https://www.moodys.com/){:.hl} in San Francisco, working on knowledge iteration and evaluation for their banking agent. Before UCSD, I was the founding Machine Learning Engineer at [CambioML (YC S23)](https://www.cambioml.com/en){:.hl} for over a year, where I trained and deployed [AnyParser](https://github.com/CambioML/any-parser), a vision-language model for document parsing, and built [Energent.ai](https://energent.ai), a computer-use agent sandbox. I studied Mathematics & Computer Science and Statistics at **UIUC** before that.

These days I spend my time on three things:

- **Agent evaluation and benchmarks** - benchmarks and diagnostics for **long-horizon** LLM agents: [SkillsBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12670), [Agents' Last Exam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.05405), [AMA-Bench](https://github.com/AMA-Bench/AMA-Bench){:.hl} (ICML 2026), and [memory-probe](https://github.com/boqiny/memory-probe){:.hl}. I also contribute to open-source agentic benchmarks: [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor){:.hl}, [Terminal-Bench](https://www.tbench.ai/), [QF-Bench](https://qfbench.com/), and [AgenticVBench](https://github.com/PhiloLabs/agentic-vbench).
- **Model training and alignment** - post-training LLMs and VLMs: supervised fine-tuning, LoRA, and RL alignment with PPO, DPO, and GRPO in PyTorch and DeepSpeed.
- **ML systems and inference** - serving models under production load with SGLang, vLLM, speculative decoding, quantization, Kubernetes, and AWS. Studied [speculative tool calling](https://github.com/boqiny/spec_tool_call) for agent latency.

**Graduating Dec 2026, open to full-time roles from Jan 2027.**
